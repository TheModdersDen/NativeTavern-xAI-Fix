# Mobile release gate

This gate is the final iOS and Android release decision for NativeTavern. A
simulator or emulator run is useful regression evidence, but it never qualifies
as a device pass.

## Commands

Run the repeatable automated checks during development:

```sh
tool/run_mobile_release_checks.sh
```

This runs the full Flutter test suite, changed-file formatting check, Live2D
artifact and license inventory audit, and mobile evidence manifest audit.

Run the strict gate after recording physical-device evidence for the current
commit:

```sh
tool/run_mobile_release_checks.sh --release
```

The strict command also runs the Live2D release audit. It requires available
iOS and Android runners, a release-mode run on each physical platform, all
matrix scenarios, the declared performance metrics, and evidence paths or
HTTPS links. It rejects device identities that contain `simulator` or
`emulator` even if `isPhysical` is set incorrectly.

## Commit and evidence order

Physical testing must use a committed, reproducible release build. Commit the
release candidate before installing it, then record and commit the resulting
evidence. The strict gate accepts a tested commit when every later change is
limited to `release_evidence/` or to the `releaseEvidence` object in the Live2D
manifest. It rejects any source, dependency, asset, or other configuration
change after the tested commit and requires a clean worktree.

This permits evidence to reference the exact binary commit without creating a
self-referential SHA requirement. Any runtime change requires rebuilding and
rerunning both physical-device matrices.

## Device protocol

Use `flutter devices --machine` before each run. Select one supported physical
Android device and one supported physical iPhone or iPad. Record the full Git
SHA from `git rev-parse HEAD`; debug/profile results do not qualify.

Build and install the same release commit:

```sh
dart run tool/build_android_release.dart
flutter build ipa --release
```

The Android helper runs `flutter pub get`, excludes dev-only plugins from the
generated release registrant, invokes `bundleRelease`, and restores the
generated file afterward. This works around Flutter 3.38 generating an
`integration_test` registration while its Gradle plugin correctly omits that
dev dependency from release compilation. It does not add test code to the
production bundle. Use JDK 17 when the local default Java runtime is newer than
the Android Gradle Plugin supports.

Run every scenario in `config/mobile_release_gate.json`. Each platform covers:

| Scenario | Device setup | Release decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offline | Airplane mode, Wi-Fi and mobile data off | Local data and typed chat remain responsive; external failures are clear. |
| Weak network | High latency, packet loss, and constrained bandwidth | Timeout/cancel recovers without duplicate sends, frozen controls, or lost drafts. |
| Permission denied | Deny microphone, speech, photos, and files at the OS prompt | Denial is recoverable and typed chat remains available. |
| Low memory | Apply OS memory pressure while backgrounded | Resume coherently or restore persisted state without corruption. |
| Foreground/background | Transition during generation, voice, Live2D, and idle text chat | Media work stops safely and state resumes coherently. |
| Performance | Profile at least 30 minutes in release mode | Every metric stays within the manifest thresholds without sustained growth. |
| Features disabled | Disable memory, RPG, Data Bank context, voice, Live2D, tools, and MCP | Create/send/swipe/edit/reopen text chat with no new permission prompt or external call. |

Use OS-supported controls for network conditioning and memory pressure. Do not
substitute a mocked service for the physical low-memory, lifecycle, permission,
power, thermal, or GPU portions.

## Evidence

Store run metadata in `release_evidence/mobile_release_runs.json`. A qualifying
run has this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "ios-2026-08-08",
  "platform": "ios",
  "device": {
    "id": "physical-device-id",
    "model": "iPhone model",
    "osVersion": "iOS version",
    "isPhysical": true
  },
  "buildMode": "release",
  "buildCommit": "40-character-lowercase-git-sha",
  "startedAt": "2026-08-08T08:00:00Z",
  "completedAt": "2026-08-08T08:45:00Z",
  "automatedChecks": {
    "fullTestSuite": "passed",
    "formatCheck": "passed",
    "live2dDevelopmentAudit": "passed",
    "manifestAudit": "passed"
  },
  "scenarios": {
    "offline": {
      "status": "passed",
      "evidence": [
        {"type": "screenRecording", "location": "release_evidence/ios/offline.mov"},
        {"type": "deviceLog", "location": "release_evidence/ios/offline.log"}
      ]
    }
  },
  "metrics": {
    "sampleMinutes": 30,
    "startupMilliseconds": 1200,
    "typedChatP95Milliseconds": 90,
    "frameBuildP95Milliseconds": 12,
    "frameRasterP95Milliseconds": 11,
    "droppedFramePercent": 0.4,
    "memoryGrowthMiB": 18
  }
}
```

Include all seven scenario objects, not only the abbreviated example above.
Evidence may be a repository-relative file or an HTTPS artifact link.

## Failure records

Set a failed or blocked scenario's `status`, attach its `failureId`, and add a
record to the top-level `failures` list:

```json
{
  "id": "MOBILE-2026-001",
  "platform": "android",
  "scenario": "foregroundBackgroundRecovery",
  "summary": "Draft cleared after process recreation",
  "observedAt": "2026-08-08T09:10:00Z",
  "reproductionSteps": [
    "Open a populated chat",
    "Type without sending",
    "Background and apply memory pressure",
    "Return to NativeTavern"
  ],
  "evidence": [
    "release_evidence/android/MOBILE-2026-001.log",
    "release_evidence/android/MOBILE-2026-001.mp4"
  ]
}
```

The release gate remains failed until a current-commit physical run passes the
scenario. Preserve failed records as regression history rather than deleting
them.
